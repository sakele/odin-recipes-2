        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 stick unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh bread cubes</li>
            <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. 
                Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. 
                Drain and let cool until easily handled.</li>
            <li>While the potatoes are cooling, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.
                Add bread cubes; cook and stir until golden brown and crunchy, 4 to 5 minutes.
                Remove from the heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer croutons to a bowl. 
                Reserve browned butter in the pan.</li>
            <li>Peel potatoes and place into a large bowl. Mash and season with nutmeg, cayenne, salt, and pepper. 
                Add eggs and mash until combined. Stir in flour just until incorporated; do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a simmer. Dampen your hands with water and scoop a spoonful of dough onto your palm.
                Shape dough into a circle, make a light indentation in the center, and place 2 or 3 croutons inside. 
                Pull dough around croutons to seal and roll into a smooth ball. Repeat to make seven more dumplings.</li>
            <li>Use a large spoon to lower dumplings, one at a time, into the simmering water. Cook until they float to the top, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. Flip dumplings and continue to cook until puffed and cooked through, about 10 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Transfer dumplings to serving plate and drizzle with reserved browned butter. Crumble remaining croutons over top and garnish with chives. Let dumplings firm up slightly before serving, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
