        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F), or more as needed</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon, vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup baking soda</li>
            <li>4 cups hot water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup josher salt, for topping</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour 1 1/4 cups warm water into a medium bowl. Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in warm water; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add yeast mixture and oil. Mix well and form into a dough. If mixture is dry, add one or two more tablespoons of water.</li>
            <li>Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease 2 baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Pour 4 cups hot water into a large bowl. Stir in baking soda until dissolved; set aside.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a rope and twist into a pretzel shape.</li>
            <li>Once all of the dough is shaped, dip each pretzel into the baking soda-hot water solution and place on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle with kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
